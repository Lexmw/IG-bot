## IG Bot

This was a very simple project to practice python and build something that was practical for my job. There are many iterations and versions of these bots, this is my guided attempt at one.

## Goals for the Project
I have a few goals for this bot, that are a little out of the box and may not come true but my hope for this project is that it will be ongoing.

* Create a UI to start and stop the bot
* Write a script that is able to follow and unfollow 
* Create one that will write comments on the IG pages
* Find out how to deploy, or host the bot so it can run on its own
* Calculate if this script can actually get people likes, follows, instagram fame
* Integrate the bot into my workload

## How to install
I dont know how to install on your computer so you wont be able to until I can figure out how you can use this lol

But if you want you can clone the repo then go ahead.
